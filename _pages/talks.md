I have done some introductory-level talks for small groups of people. So far:

* [Celery: A Distributed Task Queue](https://github.com/asgeirrr/notes/blob/master/slides-celery/celery.pdf), 2016
* [TravisCI: Continuous Integration](https://github.com/asgeirrr/notes/blob/master/slides-travisci/travis.pdf), 2016
